                <p>Natalia has a background in Physics, Mathematics and Psychology (3 x MSc), 
                    obtained at the College of Interfaculty Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, 
                    University of Warsaw. She is now completing her thesis within the Donders Graduate School, 
                    Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. 
                    Her research concerns developing new methods for connectomics in the domain of 
                    cognitive neuroimaging, i.e. for functional and effective connectivity research. 
                    Natalia also currently holds a position of a Career Development and Mentoring Manager 
                    within the <a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/">Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student 
                    and Postdoc Special Interest Group</a>, and serves as an eLife Associate within

                    In private, she is also a dedicated <a href="https://www.nataliabielczyk.com/">blogger</a>. 
                    In November 2018, she founded Stichting Solaris Onderzoek en Ontwikkeling as a response 
                    to lack of assistance for early career researchers in career development in academia and beyond.

                <p>Daniel graduated from Physics at the University of Warsaw, Poland. He is now a PhD candidate 
                    at the Department of Data-analysis, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, 
                    Ghent University, Belgium. His research concerns oscillatory brain dynamics underlying human 
                    cognitive flexibility (with a bit of focus on attention and cognitive control). 
                    He co-organised two editions of Brainhack Warsaw. He is interested in the topic of productivity 
                    and time management for ECRs. His current side-project is about how ideas and influence spread 
                    between networks of scientists on Twitter (where he is active too).</p>
                <p>Daniel and Natalia met during Master studies and successfully organised two editions of 
                    Brainhack Warsaw together.</p>
