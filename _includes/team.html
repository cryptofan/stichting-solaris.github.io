                <p>Natalia has a background in Physics, Mathematics and Psychology (3 x MSc), 
                    obtained at the College of Interfaculty Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, 
                    University of Warsaw. She is now completing her thesis within the Donders Graduate School, 
                    Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. 
                    Her research concerns developing new methods for connectomics in the domain of 
                    cognitive neuroimaging, i.e. for functional and effective connectivity research. 
                    Natalia also currently holds a position of a Career Development and Mentoring Manager

                    as a response to lack of assistance for early career researchers in career development in academia 
                    and beyond. </p>

                <h4 class="section-heading">Open Science expert</h4>
                <p>Daniel graduated from Physics at the University of Warsaw, Poland. He is now a PhD candidate 
                    at the Department of Data-analysis, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, 
                    Ghent University, Belgium. His research concerns oscillatory brain dynamics underlying human 
                    cognitive flexibility (with a bit of focus on attention and cognitive control). 
                    He co-organised two editions of Brainhack Warsaw. He is interested in the topic of productivity 
                    and time management for ECRs. His current side-project is about how ideas and influence spread 
                    between networks of scientists on Twitter (where he is active too).</p>
                <p>Daniel and Natalia have met during Master studies in Warsaw, Poland and successfully organised 
                    two editions of Brainhack Warsaw during their PhD programs together.</p>
