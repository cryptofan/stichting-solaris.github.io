                <h4 class="section-heading">Founder and Director</h4>
                <p>Natalia has a background in Physics, Mathematics and Psychology (3 x MSc), 
                    obtained at the College of Interfaculty Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, 
                    University of Warsaw. She is now completing her thesis within the Donders Graduate School, 
                    Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. 
                    Her research concerns developing new methods for connectomics in the domain of 
                    cognitive neuroimaging, i.e. for functional and effective connectivity research. 
                    Natalia also currently holds a position of a Career Development and Mentoring Manager 
                    within the <a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/"><font color="000000">Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student 
                    and Postdoc Special Interest Group</font></a>, and serves as an eLife Associate within

                    In private, she is also a dedicated <a href="https://www.nataliabielczyk.com/"><font color="000000">
                    blogger</font></a>, and a speaker, giving workshops and talks about self-development in academia
                    and transitions to industry. 
                    In November 2018, she founded Stichting Solaris Onderzoek en Ontwikkeling 
                    in a response to lack of assistance for early career researchers in career development in academia 
                    and beyond. </p>

                <h4 class="section-heading">Director & Treasurer</h4>
                <p>Stephan Heunis graduated with an M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering from Stellenbosch University 
                    in South Africa, 2012. He worked as an engineer for four years in two industries 
                    (Industrial Automation and Enterprise Mobility) before moving to Europe with the goal of 
                    studying neuroscience. Currently, Stephan is a researcher and Phd candidate at the Electrical 
                    Engineering department of the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. 
                    His research focuses on developing new acquisition and signal processing methods for 
                    functional neuroimaging that allow the tracking and visualisation of distributed brain 
                    activity patterns in real-time, i.e. while someone is inside an MRI scanner, 
                    and applying this in clinical practice. Stephan is passionate about making research and 
                    scientific practice more transparent, rigorous and inclusive. 
                    He started the <a href="https://osceindhoven.github.io/"><font color="000000">
                    Open Science Community Eindhoven</font></a>, which is part of a wide Dutch network of 
                    researchers and university employees, that focuses on improving scientific practice. 
                    He is also the founder of <a href="https://openmrbenelux.github.io/"><font color="000000">
                    OpenMR Benelux</font></a>, a community working on wider adoption of open science 
                    principles in MRI research through talks, discussions, workshops and hackathons.

                    <p>
                    Stephan and Natalia first met on the Slack channel of Brainhack, an international organisation 
                    dedicated to organising hackathons in neuroscience. Natalia gave her few words of advice for 
                    the organisation of the first edition of Stephan’s OpenMR Benelux event, and they are friends ever since.</p>

                <h4 class="section-heading">Director & Secretary</h4>
                <p>Lara Todorova is a PhD candidate at the Donders Center for Cognition, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. 
                    She is also a member of Language and Interaction Consortium. Lara received her Bachelor title 
                    in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics from the Russian State University for the Humanities, 
                    and completed her Research Master in Cognitive Science at the University of Trento, Italy. 
                    During her Internship at the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging, she worked on a 
                    visual mental imagery project within Prediction and Attention lab by Floris de Lange. 
                    In her PhD, Lara investigates how language can influence perceptual decision making using fMRI, 
                    MEG and computational modeling. Privately, Lara is interested in facilitating new channels 
                    for self-development for early career researchers, and in optimising the publication process.

                    <p>
                    Natalia and Lara first met in the Donders Graduate School, where they were working hand in hand 
                    in the same flex room. They soon discovered that they are both interested in career development, 
                    and they have been collaborating ever since.</p>

                <p>Daniel graduated from Physics at the University of Warsaw, Poland. He is now a PhD candidate 
                    at the Department of Data-analysis, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, 
                    Ghent University, Belgium. His research concerns oscillatory brain dynamics underlying human 
                    cognitive flexibility (with a bit of focus on attention and cognitive control). 
                    He co-organised two editions of Brainhack Warsaw. He is interested in the topic of productivity 
                    and time management for ECRs. His current side-project is about how ideas and influence spread 
                    between networks of scientists on Twitter (where he is active too).</p>
                <p>Daniel and Natalia have met during Master studies in Warsaw, Poland and successfully organised 
                    two editions of Brainhack Warsaw during their PhD programs together.</p>
