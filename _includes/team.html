                <p>Natalia has a background in Physics, Mathematics and Psychology (3 x MSc), 
                    obtained at the College of Interfaculty Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, 
                    University of Warsaw. She is now completing her thesis within the Donders Graduate School, 
                    Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. 
                    Her research concerns developing new methods for connectomics in the domain of 
                    cognitive neuroimaging, i.e. for functional and effective connectivity research. 
                    Natalia also currently holds a position of a Career Development and Mentoring Manager 
                    within the <a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/"><font color="000000">Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student

                <h4 class="section-heading">Director & Treasurer</h4>
                <p>Stephan Heunis graduated with an M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering from Stellenbosch University 
                    in South Africa, 2012. He worked as an engineer for four years in two industries 
                    (Industrial Automation and Enterprise Mobility) before moving to Europe with the goal of 
                    studying neuroscience. Currently, Stephan is a researcher and Phd candidate at the Electrical 
                    Engineering department of the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. 
                    His research focuses on developing new acquisition and signal processing methods for 
                    functional neuroimaging that allow the tracking and visualisation of distributed brain 
                    activity patterns in real-time, i.e. while someone is inside an MRI scanner, 
                    and applying this in clinical practice. Stephan is passionate about making research and 
                    scientific practice more transparent, rigorous and inclusive. 
                    He started the <a href="https://osceindhoven.github.io/"><font color="000000">
                    Open Science Community Eindhoven</font></a>, which is part of a wide Dutch network of 
                    researchers and university employees, that focuses on improving scientific practice. 
                    He is also the founder of <a href="https://openmrbenelux.github.io/"><font color="000000">
                    OpenMR Benelux</font></a>, a community working on wider adoption of open science 
                    principles in MRI research through talks, discussions, workshops and hackathons.

                    <p>
                    Stephan and Natalia first met on the Slack channel of Brainhack, an international organisation 
                    dedicated to organising hackathons in neuroscience. Natalia gave him few words of advice for 
                    the organisation of the first edition of Stephan’s OpenMR Benelux event, and they are friends ever since.</p>

                <p>Lara Todorova is a PhD candidate at the Donders Center for Cognition, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. 
                    She is also a member of Language and Interaction Consortium. Lara received her Bachelor title 
                    in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics from the Russian State University for the Humanities, 
                    and completed her Research Master in Cognitive Science at the University of Trento, Italy. 
                    During her Internship at the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging, she worked on a 
                    visual mental imagery project within Prediction and Attention lab by Floris de Lange. 
                    In her PhD, Lara investigates how language can influence perceptual decision making using fMRI, 
                    MEG and computational modeling. Privately, Lara is interested in facilitating new channels 
                    for self-development for early career researchers, and in optimising the publication process.

                    Natalia and Lara first met in the Donders Graduate School, where they were working hand in hand 
                    in the same flex room. They soon discovered that they are both interested in career development,

                       She studied at the University of Warsaw and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, graduating with MSc 
                       in Computer Science and BSc in Mathematics. 
                       She quickly fell in love with the Netherlands after moving here in 2010. 
                       Alicja specializes in high-performance distributed data processing systems. 
                       She is currently employed as a software engineer at Databricks in Amsterdam, 
                       where she works on improving the performance of core components of Apache Spark. 
                       Alicja is curious about the situation of researchers in the IT industry. 
                       She is also interested in methods for achieving integrity and synergy in working teams, 
                       and in how the management and global dynamics within large companies influences 
                       efficiency and work satisfaction of their workers.</p>

                       <p>Alicja and Natalia first met during their teenage years, when they both earned their
