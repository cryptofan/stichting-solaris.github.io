              Post-PhD trajectories

              <p>Our first research project concerns investigating post-PhD trajectories. 
              A typical PhD programme gives a very broad range of skills, from hard analytic skills to soft skills 
              such as an ability to self-manage, or an ability to communicate with professionals with different backgrounds. 
              Yet, little is known about the post-PhD trajectories for PhDs transferring from academia towards 
              free job market. It is no secret that in certain areas of the free marketplace, having a PhD is not 
              attractive to employers as PhDs might miss practical experience or meet difficulties adapting to a 
              lifestyle in which daily deadlines are a norm. Hence, the question: is PhD an advantage? In a long time 
              perspective, do PhDs in industry find themselves happy about their lives in general, wealthy and satisfied 
              with their professional career? Do they ever ask themselves ‘what if’? In this project, we will aim to 
              find out and to create a comprehensive report summarising our findings.</p>
