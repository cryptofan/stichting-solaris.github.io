                <p>Agenda: Saturday 2nd March, 2019, 15:00-15:20</p>
                <p>Event description:</p>
                <p>One of the strongest movements in academia nowadays, is the Open Science movement. Its main postulates 
                    are: sharing access to high quality datasets with the general public and setting new standards for 
                    research reproducibility, e.g. by sharing codes and pipelines through open-access services such as GitHub. 
                    What else can and should we share in academia? Mentoring is one example of an asset which can also be 
                    shared between researchers all around the world. Today, it is no longer the case that mentoring experience 
                    can only be received from the direct supervisor; one can and should search out for advice from multiple 
                    researchers at every career stage, independently from geographical location - especially when there is 
                    little opportunity to be mentored in the local research environment.</p>
                <p>Within the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group, 
                    we are interested in assisting early career researchers in accelerating their careers. One of our main 
                    initiatives is the International Online Mentoring Programme. Within the Programme, every member of the 
                    OHBM community worldwide can become either a mentor, a mentee or both. In this blitz talk, I will 
                    review the lessons we learned after over two years of running the programme, and recommendations we 
                    can give to young generation of researchers who are just entering their PhD.</p>
                <p>Agenda:</p> 
                <p>Saturday 2nd March 2019, 15:00-15:20</p>
                <p>Auditorium 5, Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw, Ludwika Pasteura 5, 02-093, Warsaw, Poland</p>

                <h4 class="section-heading">[3] A talk "Sharing is caring - how mentoring and open science come together 
                    to equalize chances for career development in academia" at 
                    <a href="https://openmrbenelux.github.io/">OpenMR event</a>, Leiden, January 16th 2019</h4>  
                <p>Agenda: Wednesday January 16th, 2019, 16:15-17:00</p>
                <p>Event description:</p>
                <p>In the spirit of Open Science, we tend to increase an amount of shared resources, such as codes and datasets, 
                    nowadays. However, what else can and should we share in academia? In this talk, weâ€™ll discuss mentoring 
                    as one example of a human asset which also can and should be distributed. It is no longer the case that 
                    mentoring can only be received from your direct supervisor; there are multiple other options, and you 
                    can actively search out for mentoring advice from researchers at every career stage and independent 
                    from geographical location. Within the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student and Postdoc Special 
                    Interest Group, we are interested in developing new tools assisting early career researchers in 
                    accelerating their careers. One of our main initiatives is the International Online Mentoring Programme, 
                    which, to date, attracted a few hundreds of OHBM members. After two finished cycles of the programme, 
                    we are proud to say we feature multiple success stories: mentees from all around the world getting 
                    inspired, finding new jobs and personal grants, and coming back to the Programme as mentors. 
                    Additionally, this talk aims to ignite discussion about mentorship as a competence which should be 
                    featured as part of a standard research CV and acknowledged on equal terms with other research-related 
                    competences i.e. publication record, teaching experience or received grants and awards.</p>  
                <p>Agenda:</p> 
                <p>Wednesday 16th January 2019, 17:00-17:45</p>
