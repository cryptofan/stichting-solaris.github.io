                <p class="tab">(a) <a href="https://myidp.sciencecareers.org">Individual Development Plan</a> by Science Careers:
                    a self assessment tool which can also serve as a guide for career exploration. It can help the user better understand 
                    their personal strengths and weakness given their career plans. It separates between interests and strengths.
                    It is recommended to Postdocs but early career stage ECRs can also benefit from it.</p>
                <p class="tab">(b) <a href="https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/home/en-us/strengthsfinder">Gallup StrengthsFinder</a>:
                    a commercial program to explore five main personal strengths of the user. It does not necessarily focus on strengths 
                    that you are using in your daily life, but also gives an insight on which strengths you can put forward to improve so 
                    that they become more prominent for your daily life. It also gives an explanation about the setbacks of certain strengths. 
                    This could be used to better understand oneself, be more self-aware and avoid certain behavior patterns.</p>
